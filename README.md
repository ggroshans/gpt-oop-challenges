# GPT generated OOP Challenges
### *Can you provide an Object-Oriented Programming challenge in C# at difficulty level 'X' that effectively uses multiple classes?*

As someone from a non-traditional tech background, I haven't had many opportunities to learn and apply OOP structural patterns. Entering the C#/.NET world has been exciting, but I quickly realized I needed to become proficient with OOP concepts. Unfortunately, popular coding challenge websites like CodeWars and LeetCode lack sufficient OOP-focused problems. To bridge this gap, I began using GPT to generate OOP challenges with difficulty levels ranging from 1 to 10.

These challenges have been a fantastic way to practice C#/.NET testing and explore various design patterns.

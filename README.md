# GPT generated OOP Challenges
### *On a scale of 1 to 10, could you provide a level 'X' Object-Oriented Programming challenge in C# that skillfully helps me in utilizing multiple classes?*

Coming from a non-traditional tech background, I have not had the opportunity to learn and use OOP structural patterns. My previous experience has been using TypeScript within frontend frameworks and using Python & TS within backend frameworks such as Django / Flask and Express.js (node). From my experience, these backends did not use OOP and therefore, I was really excited when I got the opportunity to dive into the C# / .NET world. I quickly learned I needed to ramp up on being comfortable with OOP; however, common coding challenge websites such as CodeWars, LeetCode, etc. do not have many challenges where OOP is required to solve the challenge. That's when I started prompting GPT for OOP challenges on a difficulty scale of 1-10
